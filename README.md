# 🚁 Drone Delivery Optimizer

## ✨ Project Description

The **Drone Delivery Optimizer** is a web-based solution designed to enhance the efficiency of last-mile delivery services using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

This project addresses the complex logistical challenge of minimizing operational costs and maximizing delivery speed by determining the most efficient delivery routes and/or the optimal central warehouse location within a service area. It uses **quantitative methods implemented in JavaScript** to analyze geographical data, shipment volumes, and operational constraints, providing a visual and data-driven tool for optimizing drone fleet management directly in the browser.

## 🚀 Features

* **Optimal Route Calculation:** Implements a customizable algorithm (e.g., shortest path or a simpler optimization routine) to find the most efficient delivery paths.
* **Warehouse Location Optimization:** Calculates the ideal centralized depot location that minimizes the total aggregate travel distance/time across all delivery points.
* **Geospatial Analysis:** Uses JavaScript-based calculations for accurate distance measurement between delivery nodes.
* **Interactive Interface:** Provides a simple web interface for users to input data or view results.
* **Data Visualization (Expected):** Renders a map or graphical representation to visualize delivery nodes, the calculated optimal routes, and the chosen warehouse location.

## 🏁 Getting Started

Since this project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, no complex installation or environment setup is necessary.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kartikkes02/Drone-Delivery-Optimizer.git
    cd Drone-Delivery-Optimizer
    ```
2.  **No dependencies to install.** All necessary files are included in the repository.

### 💡 Usage

To run the project, simply open the main HTML file in your web browser.

1.  Navigate to the project directory.
2.  **Open the main file** (typically `index.html`) with your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
    * *Tip:* You can usually do this by right-clicking the file and selecting "Open with..." or by dragging the file into an open browser window.
3.  The optimization logic will execute in your browser, and the results should be displayed on the page.

To test different scenarios, you will likely need to modify the input parameters (coordinates, shipment volumes) directly within the JavaScript files.
